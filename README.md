# Hello reader #
This is an application from 2nd year of University, made by 3 people team :)

The application was created in IntelliJ environment. 
My role was to make frontend side of this application and graphics e.g. drawing the characters :)

Functionality:
* Make your character add a new, fraction, race, skills etc.
* Save your character to library
* Roll the dices (from 4 to 100) you can roll the dices multiple times at once.
* Enjoy the music and seek for Easter egg ;)


You can see the screenshot of this application or download the project to see how this game works. (remember to add VM options)
